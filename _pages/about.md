I am a coastal scientist and numerical modeller in the [School for Oceanic and Continental Environments (EPOC)](https://www.epoc.u-bordeaux.fr/) at the [University of Bordeaux](https://www.u-bordeaux.fr/).

My researches aim to answer environmental questions regarding the transport of microplastics and the influence of seagrass decline on the physics of the ocean.

As a numerical modeller, I use and develop integrated numerical models to study the complex feedback mechanisms between currents, waves, sediment dynamics and seagrass evolutions.
